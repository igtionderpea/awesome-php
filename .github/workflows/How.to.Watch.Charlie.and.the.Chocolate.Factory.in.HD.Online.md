Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not only a movie, but also a classic children's book written by Roald Dahl in 1964. The book tells the story of Charlie Bucket, a poor boy who loves chocolate and dreams of visiting Willy Wonka's mysterious factory. He gets his chance when he finds one of the five golden tickets hidden inside Wonka's chocolate bars. Along with four other children, he embarks on a magical tour of the factory, where he encounters amazing inventions, strange creatures, and delicious treats.
 
The book has been adapted into two movies: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) starring Gene Wilder as Wonka, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) starring Johnny Depp as Wonka. Both movies have their own fans and critics, but they share some common elements, such as the songs of the Oompa Loompas, the fate of the naughty children, and the moral lessons of the story. However, they also have some differences, such as the appearance and personality of Wonka, the design and atmosphere of the factory, and the ending of the story.
